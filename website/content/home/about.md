# Biography

I am currently a Research Fellow in Psycholinguistics at the [Phonetics Lab](https://www.keel.ut.ee/et/teadus/foneetikalabor) at the [Institute of Estonian and General Linguistics](https://www.keel.ut.ee/en) of the University of Tartu, working with [P\"artel Lippus](http://www.murre.ut.ee/~partel/) on projects on morphology in Estonian spontaneous speech.

My [PhD dissertation](/files/Lõo_Dissertation.pdf) combined large-scale item designs, behavioural methods, and eye tracking as well as advanced statistics to investigate how adult native speakers of Estonian from a wide age range comprehend and produce morphologically complex words. The research was conducted under the supervision of [Juhani Järvikivi](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jarvikiv/) and [ Harald Baayen](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~hbaayen/) at the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.ualberta.ca/linguistics) of the University of Alberta.

I am also collaborating with [Pärtel Lippus](http://www.murre.ut.ee/~partel/) and Nele Põldver on an Estonian sentence reading study, looking at how word-level ambiguity is resolved on the sentence level and with Aki-Juhani Kyröläinen on a pupillometry study looking at concreteness of Estonian adjectives. In addition, I have been involved in a machine learning project with [Sowmya Vajjala](http://sowmya.public.iastate.edu/), in collaboration with Pille Eslon implementing a proficiency level classifier for Estonian as a second language.
