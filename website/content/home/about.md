# Biography

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Centre for Comparitative Psycholinguistics](http://ccp.artsrn.ualberta.ca/), [Department of Linguistics](https://www.ualberta.ca/linguistics) at the University of Alberta, working with [Juhani Järvikivi](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jarvikiv/) and in collaboration with [Anja Arnhold](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~arnhold/), [Benjamin V. Tucker](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bvtucker/) and [Gary Libben](https://brocku.ca/social-sciences/applied-linguistics/people/gary-libben/) on projects on the processing of complex words and on the reduction of referring expressions in spontaneous spoken dialogue. The position is funded by the [Words in the World](http://wordsintheworld.ca/) SSHRC Partnered Research Training Initiative.

My PhD dissertation, supervised by of [Juhani Järvikivi](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jarvikiv/) and [R. Harald Baayen](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~hbaayen/), combined large-scale item designs, behavioural methods, eye tracking as well as advanced statistics to investigate how adult native speakers of Estonian from a wide age range comprehend and produce morphologically complex words.

I am also collaborating with [Pärtel Lippus](http://www.murre.ut.ee/~partel/) and Nele Põldver on a sentence reading study, looking at how word-level ambiguity is resolved on a sentence level and with Aki-Juhani Kyröläinen on an eye tracking study looking at concreteness norms of Estonian adjectives. In addition, I have been involved in a machine learning project with [Sowmya Vajjala](http://sowmya.public.iastate.edu/) which was working on implementing an Estonian proficiency level classificator for Estonian as a second language.
