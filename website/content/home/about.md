# Biography

I am currently a research fellow in Psycholinguistics at the [Phonetics Lab](https://www.keel.ut.ee/et/teadus/foneetikalabor) at the [Institute of Estonian and General Linguistics](https://www.keel.ut.ee/en) of the University of Tartu, working with [P채rtel Lippus](http://www.murre.ut.ee/~partel/) on a project investigating production and comprehension of Estonian careful and spontaneous speech, and in particular how morphology influences these processes.

My [PhD dissertation](/files/L천o_Dissertation.pdf) combined large-scale item designs, behavioural methods, and eye tracking as well as advanced statistics to investigate how adult native speakers of Estonian from a wide age range comprehend and produce morphologically complex written words. The research was conducted under the supervision of [Juhani J채rvikivi](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jarvikiv/) and [ Harald Baayen](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~hbaayen/) at the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.ualberta.ca/linguistics) of the University of Alberta.
