# Biography

Welcome! I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Linguistics, at the University of Alberta, working with Dr. Juhani Järvikivi. The position is funded by the Words in the World SSHRC Partnered Research Training Initiative.   

My PhD dissertation, completed under the supervision of Dr. Juhani Järvikivi and Dr. R. Harald Baayen, investigated how native speakers of Estonian comprehend and produce morphologically complex words.

In addition to my dissertation work, I am also collaborating on two eye-tracking projects, where we look at how concreteness ratings affect the processing of Estonian adjectives, and how word-level ambiguity is resolved in Estonian sentence processing.
Furthermore, my research interests include Estonian as a second language and English morphological processing. Using machine learning techniques, I have been involved in a project implementing an automatic proficiency level classificator for Estonian as a second language texts.
