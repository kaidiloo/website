# Biography

Welcome! I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Linguistics, at the University of Alberta, working with Dr. Juhani Järvikivi. The position is funded by the Words in the World SSHRC Partnered Research Training Initiative.   

My research interests include psycholinguistics, morphology and quantitative linguistics. My PhD dissertation investigated how native speakers of Estonian comprehend and produce morphologically complex words.
